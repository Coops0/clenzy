## üöÄ Overview

Quickly disable AI, tracking, crypto, and other garbage features from some browsers.

## ‚úÖ Supported Platforms

### Operating Systems

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux (snap, flatpak, and local installations)

### Browsers

- Brave (stable and nightly)
- Firefox (stable, nightly, beta, and developer edition)
- Zen Browser

## ‚ú® Features

- **Opinionated Defaults** - Pre-configured settings for a clean experience
- **Automatic Backup Creation** - Safely restore if needed
- **Vertical Tabs** - Enabled by default (disable with `-V` flag)
- **Automatic** - Use auto confirmation flag (`-Y`) for script automation
- **Betterfox.js** - For Firefox & Zen: Fetches & installs the latest Betterfox.js with extra tweaks

## ü§î Why?

Modern browsers come loaded with:

- Embedded AI assistants
- Cryptocurrency wallets
- Tracking mechanisms
- Bloat

These not only slow down your browsing experience but also compromise your privacy. I got tired of spending 30 minutes
everytime I installed a browser to disable features and configure individual flags.

## ‚ùìWill you support my favorite browser?

#### I am open to new browsers, open an issue, but I will not add support for:

- Google Chrome, Edge, Opera (including GX): They are too far gone, and whoever uses them most likely doesn't care about
  their privacy.
- Vivaldi: I don't like it, and with all its "features", it's very subjective to configure.
- Any already light browser: Safari, Arc, Waterfox, Librewolf, Pale Moon, Orion, Tor, Floorp(?), Cromite, Bromite, Thorium,
  Ungoogled Chromium
- ANY AI browser: Dia

## üß© Recommendations

### Browsers

- Windows: Librewolf, Firefox, Brave
- Linux: Librewolf, Firefox, Brave<!--, Orion (in the future)-->
- macOS: Orion, Librewolf, Firefox, Safari<br>

### Search Engines

- That's it.
