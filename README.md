## üöÄ Overview

Quickly disable AI, tracking, crypto, and other garbage features from some browsers.

## ‚úÖ Supported Platforms

### Operating Systems
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux (snap and local installations)

### Browsers
- Brave (stable and nightly)
- Firefox (stable, nightly, beta, and developer edition)
- Zen Browser

## ‚ú® Features

- **Opinionated Defaults** - Pre-configured settings for a clean experience
- **Automatic Backup Creation** - Safely restore if needed
- **Vertical Tabs** - Enabled by default (disable with `--no-vertical-tabs` flag)
- **Automatic** - Use auto confirmation flag (`-Y`) for script automation
- **Betterfox.js** - For Firefox & Zen: Fetches & installs the latest Betterfox.js with extra tweaks

## ü§î Why?

Modern browsers come loaded with:
- Embedded AI assistants
- Cryptocurrency wallets
- Tracking mechanisms
- Bloated features

These not only slow down your browsing experience but also compromise your privacy. I got tired of spending 30 minutes everytime I installed a browser to disable features and configure individual flags.

## ‚ùìWill you support my favorite browser?
#### Open an issue, but I will not add support for:
- Google Chrome, Edge, Opera (including GX): They are too far gone, and whoever uses them most likely doesn't care about their privacy.
- Vivaldi: I don't like it, and with all its "features", it's very subjective to configure.
- Any other already light browser. E.g., Safari, Arc, Waterfox, Pale Moon, Orion, Tor, Floorp(?), Cromite, Bromite, Thorium, Ungoogled Chromium, etc.
  - Zen is only here for a small few User.js tweaks [in the official Betterfox repo](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/zen/user.js).
- ANY AI browser (e.g. Dia)

## üß© Recommended
