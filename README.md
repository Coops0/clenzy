## ü§î Why?
For me at least, I am very picky about my browser since I spend so much time in it.
I spend a lot of time tweaking it every time I installed it, so this makes it immediate.

## ‚ùìWill you support X browser?
#### Open an issue! I will look into it.

## üß© Recommendations
### Browsers
- Windows & Linux: Firefox, Brave
<!-- - Linux: Firefox, Brave, Orion (in the future)-->
- macOS: Orion, Firefox, Safari, Brave<br>

<sub>You can substitute Firefox with Librewolf if you are more privacy conscious, but it is less convenient for everyday
use.</sub>
