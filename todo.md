- clap
	- auto: do not ask for confirmations, just go ahead
	- have the favorites/links/bookmarks auto setting by default disabled
	- verbose
- need to redo linux paths need to setup vm somewhere
- need to check if program is running
- firefox beta, nightly, & developer version
	- https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/install.py#L48
	- NEED to find config to disable a lot of the default show icons and stuff
		- **can all of this be done thru user.js??**
		- hide sidebar shit
		- disable all telemetry
		- disable new tab bullshit
		- change to vertical tabs
		- bookmarks toolbar only on new tabs
		- disable container tabs (if beta+)
		- there will be some weird json encoded shit
- centralized links/bookmarks handler
	- also update from safari
- tell to install extensions at the end
- better zen: https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/main/zen/user.js
- need to test brave and all of them to make sure no breakage

### FUTURE:
- auto install extensions? (ublock (auto configure too???), kagi, 1pass)
	- option to configure these too
- option to set custom dns over http config (once done with mcps blocking nextdns)
- custom search engine (kagi) with backup duckduckgo in incognito
- using only brave default profile isn't the best solution
- disable setting vertical tabs wherever i can
- interactive ui for the clap settings
- notarize macos app
