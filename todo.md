- need to redo linux paths need to setup vm somewhere
- firefox collapsing sidebar at start (maybe fixed?)

### FUTURE:
- auto install extensions? (ublock (auto configure too???), kagi, 1pass)
	- option to configure these too
- option to set custom dns over http config (once done with mcps blocking nextdns)
- custom search engine (kagi) with backup duckduckgo in incognito
- using only brave default profile isn't the best solution
- disable setting vertical tabs wherever i can
- interactive ui for the clap settings
- notarize macos app
