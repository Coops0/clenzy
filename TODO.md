# Todo

- if not launched in terminal, open one
- rename darwin binaries to macos & intel/silicon
- does doing path/two work on window instead of join?
- detect if ublock origin isn't installed, if not, offer to open it in the target browser with the correct
  extension store
- firefox still showing whatsnew page on update
- keep populating executable paths

### Other Browsers

- ...

### Unlikely

- Figure out the hashing algorithm for Secure Preferences and brave, and install extensions
- ^ same thing for setting kagi/duckduckgo as default search engine
- simple UI (egui?)
- brave policies, no json so have to do it via
  os [windows example](https://gist.github.com/slashwq/b19e2b125ca45f32e754e74ecc88db2c)
