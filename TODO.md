# Todo
- flat pak?
- other browsers?
- on brave screenshots, change new tab background to color (image bg makes screenshot way larger)
- update brave after screenshot to show we now hide clock
- flag to disable backups
- optimize cargo deps features (disable default-features)

### Unlikely
- Figure out hashing algorithm for Secure Preferences and brave, and install extensions
- ^ same thing for setting kagi as default search engine
