# Todo

- flat pak?
- other browsers?
- redo demo:
    - redo the gif to show fixed logging
    - new brave screenshots: change ntp background to color, and show now we hide the clock
- detect if ublock origin isn't installed

### Unlikely

- Figure out the hashing algorithm for Secure Preferences and brave, and install extensions
- ^ same thing for setting kagi as default search engine
